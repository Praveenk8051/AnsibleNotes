## **Preface** ##
* DevOps is meant to shorten the distance between the developers
writing the code, and the operators running the application.

* Vagrant is an excellent tool for managing local virtual machines to mimic real-world infrastructure locally (or in the cloud), and Ansible — the subject of this book — is an excellent tool for provisioning servers, managing their configuration, and deploying applications, even on my local workstation!


## **Introduction** ##
* As data centers grew, and hosted applications became more complex, administrators realized they couldn’t scale their manual systems management as fast as the applications they were enabling. That’s why server provisioning and configuration management tools came to flourish.

* Ansible is extensible with modules written in a programming language you already know

## **Getting Started** ##
* *snowflake servers*— servers that are uniquely configured and impossible to recreate from scratch because they were hand-configured without documentation

* **Idempotence** is the ability to run an operation which produces the same result whether run once or multiple times

### Inventory File ###
* Ansible uses an inventory file (basically, a list of servers) to communicate with  servers. Like a hosts file (at /etc/hosts ) that matches IP addresses to domain names, an Ansible inventory file matches servers (IP addresses or domain names) to groups

* If ort 22 for SSH on the server is not used, you will need to add it to the address, like www.example.com:2222, since Ansible defaults to port 22

```ansible -i hosts.ini example -m ping -u [username]```

[username] is the user you use to log into the server. Ansible assumes you’re using passwordless (key-based) login for SSH. If you insist on using passwords, add the --ask-pass ( -k ) flag to Ansible commands (you may also need to install the sshpass package for this to work).

```ansible -i hosts.ini example -a "free -h" -u [username]```

`free -h` (to see memory statistics), `df -h` (to see disk usage statistics)
